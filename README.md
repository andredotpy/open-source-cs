# open-source-cs
This repo is almost a copy of OSSU CS degree, but it is adjusted to me. <br>
The idea is to have courses from good universities that satisfy the requirements of a undergraduate computer science degree, minus general education, and to track my goals and courses completition. <br>

[Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?) | 8 months | 2019 | 01/2023 | [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/FRPHTDKDK5FX) | I have started this course in 2019 to learn Python as I was changing carrer and ended in jan/2023 to see if there was anythin else the course thought that I doesn't already knew.
[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) | 9 weeks | 01/2023 | - | - | I have started this course, but I already work as a Python Software Developer for more than 3 years, so, it doesn't contribute to anything new to me. Maybe I will go back in this course someday in the future.

Well, there a lot more things to cover, but this is what I am focusing right now. When I complete all of this I'll update with the next steps.
